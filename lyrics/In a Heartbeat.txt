I have a dream of starting a life
I have a hope, a flame alight
This is the moment, freedom is calling
This is my start, a new beginning

I have a heart, it beats for you
A step at a time, our spirit renew
Living together under the sun
Our hearts will beat as one

In a heartbeat, I’ll be there for you
In a heartbeat, no one else will do
In a heartbeat, we will always be
Together, united; you and me

In a heartbeat, time has passed us by
In a heartbeat, we will reach the sky
In a heartbeat, this will always be
Our people, our country
This is our family

Nothing will stand in our way
We can be strong today
The flame is alive
This is our life

In a heartbeat, I’ll be there for you
In a heartbeat, no one else will do
In a heartbeat, we will always be
Together, united; you and me

In a heartbeat, time has passed us by
In a heartbeat, we will reach the sky
In a heartbeat, this will always be
Our people, our country
This is our family
