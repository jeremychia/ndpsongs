First light
Rolls across my peaceful isle
Mornings,
I wake up, refreshed, renewed
Ready to meet the bright new day
So much to look forward to
Daylight
The city has stirred to life
Your smiles
Put a spring in my step
There's a feeling that binds us one and all
Different stories, shared memories
I love my city's lively ways
Warm sunny days
Sights and sounds,
Special tastes
That add up to this place
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's love at first light
Night fall,
Stars twinkling on the bay
My dreams can take flight if I dare
There's a feeling that binds us one and all
We look forward to a brighter day
I love my city's lively ways
Warm sunny days
Sights and sounds,
Special tastes
That add up to this place
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's love at first light
Hand in hand, we'll find new strength
And see our dreams take flight in Singapore
Singapore
I love my city's lively ways (Where ever we roam)
Warm sunny days (There's no place like home)
Sights and sounds, special tastes (Come what may)
That add up to this place (We'll be here to stay)
I love my friends, my closest ties
Now I finally realize
When it feels this right
You know that it's love at first light
When it feels this right
You know that it's
Love at first light
