I will be here
Right by your side, here
I will hold near
All that we love so dear
Not looking elsewhere
My life is here to share
Just want to show I care

I know we just got started
And I’m excited
It may not seem all perfect
But you know what?
Our story’s just beginnin’
I’m gonna give it my all
Oh yea

Together we can reach for
the stars
(with hope in our hearts)
Together we are stronger
as one
(let’s walk hand in hand)
Together we’ll make
dreams come true
(won’t ever give up)
Together sharing the love
with all that we do

Let our hearts sing
Wooh ho-oh^oh! Wooh ho-
oh. oh,oh!
Wooh ho-oh^oh! Wooh-ho-
oh-oh.oh,
Together
Together as one
We’re so much more

It seems like so long ago
When we got started
We wanted everything right
But you know what
Our story keeps on going
We’ll give it our all

Yo! I may look like I’m just
a tiny thing
Here I am, I can bravely
sing
For sure I’m gonna give
you my everything
Like how I play when that
recess bell rings
I’m gonna give it my all
Cos this is my home
I love
I love
I love
I love my Singapore

Let’s join up the dots
Light up this spot
That we call home
Many memories and stories
to be shared
Like the colours of the
rainbow we will shine ever
so bright
Together we shine
Together we shine
