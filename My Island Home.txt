This is my home
Sheâ€™s everything to me
Grace and beauty
In all that you see

My island home
Wherever I may be
I never will forget her
Nor will she forget me

And I will sing
A song of home
A land of peace
Where dreams are born everyday
My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me 

My island home
Home of my family
This is my future
Where I want to be
(This is my future
This is my home)


My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me
A part of me
