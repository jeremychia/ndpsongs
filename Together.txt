Let us be together
Aspire to achieve
No matter what, no matter when
Working hand in hand
Let us go the distance
Reach for goals that shine
Creating our future
With everyone in mind
Together we make a difference
One voice, one destiny
We remain undivided
Our hearts in harmony
Together we make a difference
Our friends, our families
We will share a special dream
Together we feel the Singapore heartbeat
Let us find in our strides
New strength to go on by
Nothing is ever easy
We have to hold on and strive
Let us never be afraid
If we have to change our ways
Through the years we'll always stay
One in every way
