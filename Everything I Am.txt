I want you to understand   
Because of you, I am who I am 
Because of who you are
I can be Everything I am

Show me how I should be strong
Teach me that I can be weak
Because of who you are   
I can find anything I seek

And In each other, there will be
The colours of your tapestry 
Colours youâ€™ve never seen

Here's to my home, to my homeland
To every shining crystal in the sand
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am
Here's to you, to my homeland 
I hold this precious jewel in my hand  
Because of who you are   
I can be everything I am

Teacher teach me to be kind 
Quick to embrace 
And slow to close my mind  
If we reach that star
We'll have the universe in time

And In each other, there will be
The fabric of our destiny
It's more than you and me

Here's to my home, to my homeland
A sea of shining crystals in the sand
Because of who you are
I can be everything I am 

Here's to you, Singapore (homeland)
Here's to my people I could want nothing more
Here's to you, Singapore (homeland)
We hold this precious jewel in our hands

Because of who you are
Because of who you are  
I can be everything I am
