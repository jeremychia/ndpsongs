For all those of you listening at home (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Let's take a walk down memory lane
Remember the days
We set out together with faith?
Remember the times, so fine
When we thought
Nothing could stand in our way?
Then things weren't the same
The life that we knew had to change
We've struggled through
The darkest storms
We thought we couldn't tame
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Through many years gone by
We've moved ahead together
We've built a brave new world
Where we could shine and grow
Oh, and now we only have
To look towards tomorrow
To carry on the dream
As far as it will go
So now we look around us, and we see
Ooh, a nation built with love by you and me
A land to treasure
Right down to the core
Our home, our heart, our Singapore
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Our home, our heart, our Singapore
To my people of the future
We built it for the ones that dream
Hand in hand, we'll make our land
Our home, the place to be
From young to gold
Our stories unfold
Moments like these will speak
Words that last forever
Worlds that come together
To show that we're all the same
We'll break the chains, to make a change
Burn bright, our lion city flame
And amazing as it seems (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It all started with a dream
But the dreaming isn't done
'Cause the best is yet to come
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Our home, our heart, our Singapore
(Our Singapore)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (whoa, whoa)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (our dream, yeah)
Our home, our heart, our Singapore
Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we've come so far
And there's still a long, long way to go
With all of my heart, I will care
I'll play my part, I will share
With family and friends
Together we'll stand
And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Our home (our home)
Our heart (our heart)
Our dream
