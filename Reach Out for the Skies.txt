At a time when hope was low
The journey seemed unsure
But through it all
We've kept the flame alive
Now standing proud and tall
Our spirit strong and free
Building on hopes and dreams
It's here we want to be
Let's reach out for the skies
With wings we soar up high
Our dreams we'll all achieve
We'll make our destiny
Let's reach out for the skies
With wings we soar up high
Our dreams we'll all achieve
Let's soar and reach for the skies
When I think about my dreams
The future it can be
The time has come for me
To strive and to achieve
With hopes within our hearts
As one hand in hand
For family and our friends
Let's do the best we can
Let's reach out for the skies
With wings we soar up high
Our dreams we'll all achieve
We'll make our destiny
Let's reach out for the skies
With wings we soar up high
Our dreams we'll all achieve
Let's soar and reach for the skies
Our dreams we'll all achieve
Let's soar and reach for the skies
We can touch the skies
