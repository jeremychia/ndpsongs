How many times have you heard them say;
“The future is uncertain and everything must change”
Well all of my worries and all of my fears
Begin to lose their weight, when I hold you near
 
If all that we are is what we believe
Then I know I’ve got to be the change I want to see
How easy we forget that everything takes time
No, nothing's ever perfect, but I still call you mine
 
This is my country, this is my flag
This is my future, this is my life
This is my family, these are my friends
We are Singapore, Singaporeans

This is my country, this is my flag
This is my future, this is my life
This is my family, these are my friends
We are Singapore, Singaporeans
 
We, the citizens of Singapore,
pledge ourselves as one united people,
regardless of race, language or religion,
to build a democratic society
based on justice and equality
so as to achieve happiness, prosperity
and progress for our nation.

This is my country, this is my flag
This is my future, this is my life
This is my family, these are my friends
We are Singapore, Singaporeans
 
We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We will stand together, hear the lion roar
We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We’re a nation strong and free forever more
(This is my country, this is my flag) We are Singapore, we are Singapore
(This is my future, this is my life) We will stand together, hear the lion roar
(This is my family, these are my friends) We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We are Singapore, Singaporeans
We are Singapore, Singaporeans
