Raise your head to the skies

This is how we all begin
See the fire in your eyes
Feel the yearning deep within
Take a leap and you will fly
With all the wishes that you own
Make your dreams light up the sky
Home is where you’re not alone

And our hearts will beat together

Echoing what dreams may come
Walking tall in any weather
Time has come bang the drum
Cause tomorrow's here today

Dream away
Take the world by the hand
Cause tomorrow's here today
Dream away
Come let's go right away
Cause tomorrow's here today


Step into a brand new day
Tomorrow's calling out your name
When you know just who you are
You can't stop you are on fire
Looking up beyond the stars
Fly the flag and raise it higher

And our hearts will beat together

Echoing what dreams may come
Walking tall in any weather
Time has come bang the drum
Cause tomorrow's here today


When we run along
And we’re standing tall
When we sing our song
No way that we can fall
Be what we want to be
When we make our way
Till it’s plain to see

Tomorrow’s here today

Yeah

Take the world by the hand

Cause tomorrow's here today
Yeah
Come let's go right away
Cause tomorrow's here today
