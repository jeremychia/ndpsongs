In the early years, our poor pioneers
worked down by the riverside
Drawn from many lands
with dreams in their hands
the values they gave us survive

As four streams flow
to make one river grow
so we came together as one
We live side by side 
and share island wide
a style Singaporean

This is our home, a home that's grown
from a little room
to a country of our own
Now we welcome every one to see
Singapore - a city for the world

we reach out our hands
to friends in far off lands
and bridge dividing streams
Together we can build
a world which is filled
with hope of the Singapore dream

This is our home, a home that's grown
from a little room
to a country of our own
Now we welcome every one to see
Singapore - a city for the world
